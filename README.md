# tithe-maps-2025
Code and data from a small project at Hacathon Hanes at the National Library of Wales
Because of file size restrictions one of the files has been zipped and will need to be unzipped for the code to work ([tithe_points_ceredigion.dbf.zip](https://github.com/likeaword/tithe-maps-2025/blob/main/tithe_points_ceredigion.dbf.zip))

A short write up of the project is on my blog [19th Century landuse patterns](https://blog.benproctor.co.uk/f00e5501d5ee?source=friends_link&sk=5fd6527631162cdf614138c1c1ea8e65)
